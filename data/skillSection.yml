  #### Please take this into consideration:  
  
  This is only meant as a rough estimate - mostly for fun, partially for my own focus and motivation. As with all agile software projects, our vision gets blurrier the further ahead we project. Assumptions are made, efforts are estimated and lines are sketched but nothing here is stone or even fully known.
